# library_management
This is my 12th standard library management project.
it is based on python and django where i have coded django part which include creating account ,login,logout,resetting password and sending data to mysql db using form. well i got the images of codes so convert them using imagetotext.info website.  This project is not idle to take references it doesn't any good quality of code , but every good quality coder start with bad code and learn from it.

well if you use this project to build your starting project then don't forget to configure your email in setting.py and add background.gif which i haven't uploaded.


also checkout docx and lib management 4.py which is python file for libmanagement

Notes:"Images added to this project is not my work taken from the internet"
